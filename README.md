# Messaging-App
I've built this messaging app by using Google's Firebase Firestore service 
as a Backend Database to store and retrive messages.
To integrate Firebase, I've used Cocoapods as dependency manager and 
also used Swift package manager to add functionality to control Keyboard related functionality.
